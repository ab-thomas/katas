FizzBuzz
--------

- The aim of this kata is to implement a FizzBuzz method. The method replaces any number divisible by 3 with 'Fizz', and number divisible by 5 with 'Buzz', and any number divisible by both 3 and 5 with 'FizzBuzz'. Other numbers remain untouched.

- A [refactored version here] showing each refactoring stage and a [JavaScript version] using Jasmine TDD.
